# AlexaMathChampionship

The 'Math Championship' skill is for kids ( 6 to 10 years ). 
Kids will surely have fun learning tables with Alexa.

It can help lean tables and play quiz about it. 

You can say,
1. Alexa, ask Math Championship, to tell me table of {Number}
2. Alexa, ask Math Championship, to start a game (for tables from 1 to 11, randomly)
3. Alexa, ask Math Championship, to ask me table of {Number}

PS: Kids from my family adore learning tables with it
